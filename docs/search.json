    "text": "I am an ecologist interested in understanding general patterns in how biological systems respond to environmental change, and combining this with local knowledge to address urgent socio-ecological problems. My work focuses on clarifying direct and indirect effects of climate change on resource availability, and consequences for species interactions and ecosystem functioning. I combine theory and experiments to explore these topics in multiple biological systems, but am primarily interested in aquatic and marine microbial systems."
